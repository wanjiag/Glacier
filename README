Code sequence:
01_dcm2bids.batch can be run directly.

Change subject number in fmriprep/participants.tsv
Load python3, run fmriprep_create_python.py -> generate new bash file in fmriprep/sbatch
Run the newly generated file in fmriprep/sbatch

02.1 and 02.2 run same code. 02.1 is supposed to be used for single subject, but 02.2 can parallel multiple subjects. 
02.1: change --subs into current subject before running.
02.2: change glm_participants.tsv before running. The bash code is generated in glm_sbatch. (similar procedure as running fmriprep in the previous step.)

03_ashs.batch and 02 can be run at the same time. Change subject id in 03 before running the code.

04_roi.batch can be run with specified subject using --sub, or the subjects can be detected automatically: subject with a folder in glm output, but doesn't have a folder in roi output. Visual cortex can be run alone using -v, hippocampus subfields from ASHS can be run alone using -a.

05_csv.batch will automatically detect subjects with a folder in roi output folder, but not in the csv output.
