Code:
01_dcm2bids.batch can be run directly.

Change subject number in fmriprep/participants.tsv
Load python3, run fmriprep_create_python.py -> generate new bash file in fmriprep/sbatch/
Run the newly generated file in fmriprep/sbatch/

02.1 and 02.2 are basically the same code. 02.1 is better if there is only one subject to be processed; 02.2 can parallel multiple subjects. 
02.1: change --subs into current subject before running.
02.2: change glm_participants.tsv before running. The bash code will be generated in glm_sbatch/. It is a similar procedure as running fmriprep in the previous step.

03_ashs.batch and 02.x can be run at the same time. Change subject id in 03 before running the code.

04_roi.batch can be run with specified subject using --sub, or the subjects will be detected automatically: subject who has a glm output folder, but not roi output folder. Visual cortex can be run alone using -v; hippocampus subfields from ASHS can be run alone using -a.

05_csv.batch will automatically detect subjects who have a folder in roi output folder, but not in the csv output.
